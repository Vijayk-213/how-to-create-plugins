# Fullname Generator Plugin

This repository contains a TypeScript plugin that invokes a Python script to generate a full name by combining a first name and last name passed as parameters.

## Features

- **TypeScript Plugin**: A seamless integration for executing Python scripts from a TypeScript environment.
- **Python Backend**: A Python script (`fullname.py`) processes the input and returns the concatenated full name.
- **Cross-Language Communication**: Demonstrates interoperability between TypeScript and Python.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vijayk-213/how-to-create-plugins
